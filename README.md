## My Journey

Currently, I'm focusing more on my studies(KCSE📚), but I'm trying to stay active on GitHub and dive deeper into computer science. **Fair warning:** I'm not fluent in any coding language yet, but I'm working on it! 

### Goal

-Connect with like-minded people from different backgrounds. That means I'll be multilingual at some point in life😄. Well, currently I'm fluent in English and Swahili, so I guess I have one more other language to learn in order to be multilingual. What language should I learn next?

## Anyway...
To learn more, you can find me at a Drake concert near you 😅.
