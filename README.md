## My Journey

Currently, I'm focusing more on my studies(KCSE📚), but I'm trying to stay active on GitHub and dive deeper into computer science. **Fair warning:** I'm not fluent in any coding language yet, but I'm working on it! 

### Goal
-Connect with like-minded people from different backgrounds. That means I'll be multilingual at some point in life😄. Well, currently I'm bilingual in English and Kiswahili, so I guess I can be a translator to anybody coming to Kenya🤷‍♂️. What language should I learn next?

## Anyway...
To learn more about me, try finding me at a Drake concert near you 😅.
