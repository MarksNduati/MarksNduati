##Fact: Your brain is the most complex structure in the known universe, containing about 86 billion neurons(86,000,000,000) and has more connections than the known number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. You ain't dumb bro.
Hey. How's your day going so far?
I'm Marks. Yes, Marks. Not Mark, Marcus, Maxwell, Maxmilian, Maximizing😂. I'm a 17-year-old currently living in Thika, Kenya. I'm currently in high school and will be doing my KCSE this year. I'm a CS enthusiast, car addict, and fact lover. Currently, I'm focused more on my studies, but I'm trying my best to stay active on GitHub and CS stuff. So I'm not fluent in any coding language, yet. My goal is to surround myself with like-minded people and connect with people from different backgrounds. That means I need to be multilingual (Slight foreshadowing🙄). We'll, I'm currently bilingual because I speak English and Kiswahili fluently. What language should I learn next? Anyway, that's basically me. To learn more, try finding me at a Drake concert near you.
